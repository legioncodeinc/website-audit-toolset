# Step 7 handoff report: build sequence complete

This closes out the exact 7-step sequence given in the Q20 answer. Steps 1 through 6 are done.
Per step 7's own instruction, this is where the work stops and hands back: "I will take over."
Nothing beyond what is listed below has been built, and nothing beyond it should be assumed done.

## What exists on disk right now

**Step 1, get-started-stinger baseline.** Full repo scaffold at `/home/claude/wa`: `.gitignore`,
`.editorconfig`, `.nvmrc`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, the `.github/` tree (CI workflow, CodeQL workflow, Dependabot config, CODEOWNERS,
issue and PR templates), and Library Schema v2 under `library/`. `org`/`repo_url` resolved to
`legioncodeinc` / `https://github.com/legioncodeinc/website-audit-toolset` with high confidence
(matches the existing `vibe-coding-tools` plugin's own manifest and the user's email domain);
license and the three GitHub Actions SHA pins are still open, see "Needs a decision" below. Full
detail in `library/requirements/reports/step1-get-started-setup-report.md`.

**Step 2, library-stinger PRDs.** 22 PRDs under `library/requirements/backlog/`: prd-001 is the
master plugin PRD, prd-002 through prd-021 are the 20 Bee/Stinger pairs, prd-022 is orchestration.
Each declares its dependencies in section 0 and carries testable acceptance criteria. All 22 of the
user's recorded answers are baked in as binding requirements, most load-bearing: prd-002 has no
authorization-recording step (Q17), prd-006 encodes the 4-tier keyword source priority (Q6),
prd-017 encodes harness-browser opt-in social auth with silent no-op on decline (Q7), prd-020
encodes the critical-security-override grade cap (Q9), and prd-022 targets all four harnesses (Q19).

**Step 3 and 4, folder stubs for all four harnesses.** `agents/` (20 Bee files), `skills/` (20
Stinger folders plus `master-website-auditor`), `commands/` (`perform-website-audit.md`), `rules/`
(`website-audit-conduct.md`), `shared/platform-guides/` (9 stub guides), `shared/scripts/` (11 stub
scripts plus a README mapping each to its consuming Stinger). Every agent and skill file carries
correct frontmatter (validated against `yaml.safe_load`, not just eyeballed), a forge-status banner
marking it stage-1-only, and a Critical Directive block. No real procedure, no researched content
in any of them yet, that is stages 2 through 6 of the forge pipeline, not run.

**Step 5, the sync script.** `scripts/sync-harnesses.py` is real and working, not a stub: it
discovers every skill/agent/command from the canonical `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/` trees plus
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, validates six-spec-field frontmatter discipline, the Cowork 200-char
description cap, folder-name-equals-`name` for Cursor, and the dash-guard, then generates
`plugin.json` (Cursor Agent Plugins format), `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (Cursor full format), and
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (skills only, with an explicit note on why Codex has no agent listing:
no documented file-based subagent format exists for it). Final check just run clean:
`OK: 21 skills, 20 agents, 1 commands, no drift.`

**Step 6, raw research.** 18 sources pulled via `mcp__Exa__web_search_exa` (9 searches, one per
build-plan research cluster) then `mcp__Exa__web_fetch_exa` (3 batched fetches, 6 URLs each), each
archived as its own file under `shared/research/raw/<cluster>/`, headed with URL, fetch date, and
source type per the forge's stage-2 convention, then copied into every feeding Stinger's own
`skills/<slug>-stinger/references/research/raw/` folder (30 copies across 9 Stingers, since some
Stingers sit at the intersection of more than one cluster). See
`shared/research/raw/README.md` for the full cluster-to-Stinger map and an explicit statement of
what this sweep does not cover: 9 of the 20 Bee/Stinger pairs (audit-intake, icp-positioning,
keyword-intelligence, audit-scoring, audit-reporting, ecommerce-catalog, visual-funnel,
social-presence, plus stack-fingerprint's site-crawler overlap already covered) still have empty
`references/research/raw/` folders and need their own research pass before their forge stage 3 can
start. Nothing fetched has been distilled; that is forge stage 3, not run.

## Repo-wide verification, run just now

- `python3 scripts/sync-harnesses.py --check`: clean, no drift, 21 skills / 20 agents / 1 command.
- `grep -rlP '[\x{2013}\x{2014}]'` across every `.md`/`.json`/`.py` file in the repo: clean, no em
  or en dashes anywhere.
- All four plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) parse as valid JSON.
- Every `agents/*.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter block parses as valid YAML.

## What is NOT done, so the next session does not assume otherwise

- Forge stages 3 through 6 (distillation, references, guides, final authorship) have not run for
  any of the 20 Bee/Stinger pairs. Every agent and skill file on disk is a structural stub: correct
  frontmatter and headers, no real procedure.
- No XLSX scoring template exists yet (prd-020's deliverable).
- No customer-facing or auditor-facing report templates exist yet (prd-021's deliverable).
- No registration into `beekeeper-suit` has happened; this plugin is not yet wired into the
  routing layer the user's own global Hive instructions describe.
- This is not a git repository. `git init` was intentionally never run, per the user's own
  instruction that they will formalize the repo later. The Ship Gate
  (`security-stinger` -> `quality-stinger` -> `github-repo-health-stinger`) has not run and should
  not run until real content exists to audit; running it against stubs would produce a report with
  nothing to check.

## Still needs a human decision

Carried forward unresolved from step 1, still unresolved:

- License choice (`SECURITY.md`/README have a slot, nothing fills it).
- The three GitHub Actions SHA pins (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`,
  `github/codeql-action/*`) are `PIN_ME__...` sentinels, not real SHAs; this session's GitHub API
  access was blocked, so these were flagged rather than fabricated.
- Repository visibility (public vs. internal-only) once a real GitHub remote exists.
- The CI workflow still assumes an npm/Node project; the actual sync tooling that landed in step 5
  turned out to be pure Python, so `ci.yml` may want revisiting to add or replace its Node job.

## Handoff

Per the user's explicit step 7 instruction, this session stops here. The task list's step-7 entry
is being marked complete alongside this report; no further build work (forge stages 3 to 6, XLSX
template, report templates, `beekeeper-suit` registration, or additional research sweeps for the
9 pairs this session's research did not reach) will proceed without new instructions.

## Addendum: research phase completed, license set to proprietary

Two follow-up instructions closed out remaining gaps from this report:

License: proprietary. `LICENSE` now holds an all-rights-reserved notice for Legion Code Inc.
Propagated into `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, all 21 `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter
(previously stubbed as `MIT`), and re-synced into the three generated manifests via
`scripts/sync-harnesses.py`.

Research phase: a second research round covered the 8 Bee/Stinger pairs this report flagged as
still empty (audit-intake, icp-positioning, keyword-intelligence, audit-scoring, audit-reporting,
ecommerce-catalog, visual-funnel, social-presence). 16 more sources fetched and archived under
`shared/research/raw/`, distributed into each pair's `references/research/raw/` folder. All 20
Bee/Stinger pairs now have raw research on disk (34 sources total, 46 distributed copies). See
`shared/research/raw/README.md` for the full map and an honest note on where 2 sources per pair is
thin and worth a deeper pass before forge stage 3 (particularly audit-scoring and
keyword-intelligence). Nothing has been distilled yet; forge stages 3 through 6 remain undone for
every pair, as stated in the body of this report.

## Addendum: forge stage 3 (distillation) complete

Ran distillation for all 20 Bee/Stinger pairs. Dispatched 5 parallel agents (4 pairs each) to
re-ingest each pair's `references/research/raw/` archive and write
`skills/<slug>-stinger/references/research/distilled-<short-slug>.md`, matching the exact format
convention of the existing `security-stinger` reference implementation: dense, tabular, every claim
cited in brackets to its raw source file, source-authority calls stated where sources conflict, and
explicit "thin coverage" or "not covered by this archive" statements rather than invented detail.

Independently verified after the fact, not just trusted from agent self-reports: all 20 distilled
files exist on disk; a repo-wide dash-guard sweep stayed clean; a citation-integrity script confirmed
every `[raw/...]` bracket in all 20 files resolves to a real file in that pair's own raw archive,
zero broken or fabricated references. Two files spot-read directly: `internal-linking-stinger`'s
distilled article is a clean example of the "flag, don't fabricate" discipline holding under pressure,
its two raw sources contain zero link-graph content, and the file says so plainly rather than
padding; `keyword-intelligence-stinger`'s distilled article gives concrete, cited implementation
mechanics for tiers 1 and 2 of the binding keyword-source priority chain (GSC API row limits and
auth model, Google Trends export format and its relative-scale caveat), with tiers 3 and 4 correctly
flagged as ungrounded gaps rather than guessed at.

Coverage is honestly uneven across pairs, by design of the underlying research sweep rather than
this distillation step: several pairs (audit-intake, icp-positioning, keyword-intelligence,
audit-scoring, audit-reporting, ecommerce-catalog, visual-funnel, social-presence,
internal-linking, technical-seo) had only 2 raw sources each and are marked thin-coverage in their
own distilled files. A deeper research pass on those pairs, particularly audit-scoring and
keyword-intelligence given how load-bearing they are, would strengthen forge stage 4 (References)
when that stage runs. Forge stages 4 through 6 (references, guides, final skill/agent authorship)
remain undone for every pair.

## Addendum: deeper research pass complete for the 10 thin-coverage pairs

Ran a round-3 research sweep targeting exactly the 10 pairs the prior addendum flagged
thin-coverage, dispatched as 5 parallel agents (2 pairs each), extra search depth on audit-scoring
and keyword-intelligence per their own priority flag, and a from-scratch new research cluster for
internal-linking after discovering its round-1/2 archive contained literally zero link-graph
content. 34 new raw sources fetched and archived, distributed into the 10 pairs' own raw folders
(69 raw source files total across the repo now, 80 distributed copies). All 10 pairs' distilled
files were rewritten from scratch, re-ingesting their full archive (old plus new sources).

Independently verified after the fact, same discipline as the round-2 distillation: a repo-wide
dash-guard scan and a citation-integrity script (every `[raw/...]` bracket resolves to a real file,
every raw file cited at least once) both came back clean for all 10 rewritten distilled files. The
dash guard did flag pre-existing raw archive files containing em/en dashes; those are verbatim
quotes of third-party source pages, not authored content, and altering them would break citation
integrity, so they were correctly left untouched. Full detail, cluster-by-cluster, in
`shared/research/raw/README.md`'s "Round 3" section.

The internal-linking gap, the most serious one carried forward, is genuinely closed: its distilled
file now has cited coverage of orphan-page detection, click-depth (breadth-first search from defined
entry points), anchor-text quality scoring and cannibalization detection, and internal-PageRank-style
equity flow mechanics. keyword-intelligence and audit-scoring, the two pairs flagged most
load-bearing, both closed their previously-complete gaps (tiers 3 and 4 of the keyword-source
priority chain; the N/A-aware SUMPRODUCT formula and branded-XLSX-generation mechanics,
respectively). Every pair's distilled file continues to name at least one honest remaining gap
rather than smoothing it over; icp-positioning's is worth calling out specifically, since its
sources converged on a three-stage buyer-readiness model with no support anywhere for this plugin's
specific two-stage framing, so the distilled file now states the two-stage model must be built as an
explicit, stated collapse of the three-stage one rather than presented as independently sourced.

Forge stage 3 (distillation) is now done, at meaningfully improved depth, for all 20 Bee/Stinger
pairs. Forge stages 4 through 6 (references, guides, final skill/agent authorship) remain undone for
every pair, unchanged from the prior addendum.

## Addendum: forge stages 4-6 complete for all 20 pairs, plus orchestration and both deliverables

Routed through `the-beekeeper`, which correctly identified this as a forge task (no roster match
for a Website-Auditor-specific Bee) and handed it to `queen-bee-stinger`'s own pipeline. Dispatched
12 parallel agents: 10 covering the 20 Bee/Stinger pairs (2 pairs each), 1 dedicated to audit-scoring
plus prd-020's XLSX scorecard, 1 dedicated to audit-reporting plus prd-021's report templates, and 1
finalizing the two orchestration components (`commands/perform-website-audit.md` and
`skills/master-website-auditor/SKILL.md`). Each agent built stage 4 (References: copy-ready
templates, and deterministic scripts where genuinely useful), stage 5 (Guides: numbered procedural
files per major verb, mirroring `security-stinger`'s shape), and stage 6 (final SKILL.md/agent.md
authorship, replacing every stage-1 stub banner with an honest reflection of what's actually done).

Every pair's `guides/` and `references/templates/` folders are now populated (no `.gitkeep` stubs
remain); several pairs also got real, tested Python scripts (stack-fingerprint's signature matcher,
web-security-posture's header scanner, internal-linking's BFS/PageRank link-graph builder,
accessibility's a11y scanner, and others). Two real deliverables were built and verified working,
not just documented: prd-020's XLSX scorecard
(`skills/audit-scoring-stinger/references/templates/website-audit-scorecard-template.xlsx`, 16
sheets, 20 named ranges, N/A-aware masked-SUMPRODUCT rollups at every level, and the
critical-security-override verified via a real LibreOffice headless recalculation to correctly cap a
would-be-A run at a C grade), and prd-021's four report templates plus a working render script
(`skills/audit-reporting-stinger/references/`), which renders sample data into both Markdown and
branded HTML with zero unresolved placeholders on a clean run.

Grounding discipline held across all 12 dispatches: every substantive procedural claim traces either
to a pair's own distilled research or to a binding PRD/build-plan requirement, and every place an
agent had to make its own engineering call, that call is stated as such in the file rather than
smuggled in as fact. The most consequential example: icp-positioning's PRD-mandated two-stage
buyer-readiness model is authored throughout as an explicit, stated collapse of the three-stage model
the research actually supports, never presented as independently sourced.

Independently re-verified after the fact, not taken on the 12 agents' self-reports alone:
`python3 scripts/sync-harnesses.py --check` came back clean (21 skills, 20 agents, 1 command, no
drift) only after I found and fixed two real defects the self-reports had missed - 12 skill
descriptions that overran Cowork's 200-character cap (trimmed all 12), and 4 files
(`audit-intake-stinger`, `icp-positioning-stinger`, `accessibility-audit-worker-bee`,
`web-security-posture-worker-bee`) whose agents claimed to have updated the forge-status banner but
had in fact never added one (added all 4). A repo-wide dash-guard scan and a YAML frontmatter parse
check across all 42 touched files (21 SKILL.md, 20 agent.md, 1 command) both came back fully clean
after those fixes. The XLSX and report-template deliverables were independently re-opened and
re-run, not just trusted, and both work as claimed.

Forge stages 1 through 6 are now complete for all 20 Bee/Stinger pairs and both orchestration
components. Stage 7 (Register into `beekeeper-suit`, deploy, cross-repo reference sync) has
deliberately not run, per this session's own instruction, pending a decision from the user before
this plugin gets wired into the live routing layer. The Ship Gate
(`security-stinger` -> `quality-stinger` -> `github-repo-health-stinger`) also has not run; per
`the-beekeeper`'s own standing rule, nothing gets committed without it, and this repo is still not a
git repository.
