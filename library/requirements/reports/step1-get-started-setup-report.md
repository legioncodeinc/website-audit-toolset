# Step 1 setup report: get-started-stinger

## 1. Already present

None. The target directory (`/home/claude/wa`, mirroring the user's local `website-audit-toolset` folder) contained only this session's own working files (`plan/website-auditor-build-plan.md` and a scratch `plan/.fix.py`) before this run. Nothing from the template set collided with existing work, so nothing was skipped.

## 2. Created this run

All 29 template-set files were created: `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.nvmrc`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the full `.github/` tree (CI workflow, CodeQL workflow, Dependabot config, CODEOWNERS, issue templates, PR template), and the full `library/` tree (Library Schema v2: `knowledge/{public,private}`, `requirements/{backlog,in-work,completed,reports}`, `issues/{backlog,in-work,completed}`, `notes/`).

Placeholder resolution, grouped by how confident the fill is:

Resolved with high confidence from context already given this session: `project_name` = "Website Auditor by Legion Code Inc.", `security_email` = mario@legioncodeinc.com, `default_branch` = main, `codeql_languages` = python (the sync script planned for Step 5 follows the Hive's own `generate-harnesses.py` convention), `codeql_schedule_cron` = weekly Monday 06:00 UTC.

Resolved with a working default, flagged for review: `repo` = "website-audit-toolset" (the folder name in use; not yet a formal package name), `branch_prefix` = "wa", `version` = "0.1.0", `install_command`/`lint_command`/`test_command`/`typecheck_command` = placeholder no-ops, since no build tooling exists yet, these will need real commands once Steps 4 and 5 land actual scripts. `package-ecosystem` in `dependabot.yml` was set to `pip` on the same anticipation, with an inline comment noting it self-no-ops if no `requirements.txt` ever appears.

Left as explicit TODO markers rather than guessed, per the "flag, don't fabricate" rule: `org`, `repo_url` (Q2 in the build plan: GitHub-public vs. internal-only is still undecided), `license_name` (this skill does not choose a license), and all CODEOWNERS handles (`@TBD-owner`) since no GitHub org/username has been established yet. The two GitHub Actions commit SHAs (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`) and the CodeQL action SHA were left as clearly-named `PIN_ME__...` tokens rather than fabricated, this session's network access to the GitHub API was blocked (`GitHub access to this repository is not enabled for this session`), and inventing a SHA for a security-relevant pin is worse than flagging it honestly.

## 3. Needs a human decision

**Requires GitHub Settings / admin access, once a remote exists:** enable Secret Protection + Push Protection; enable branch protection/ruleset on `main` (require PR, required status checks, required Code Owner review, block force-push); decide CodeQL native default setup vs. the committed `codeql.yml` (don't run both); choose and set a LICENSE.

**Requires a decision this skill flagged but didn't make:** Dependabot (shipped) vs. Renovate, not needed at this repo's current single-ecosystem size. husky+lint-staged vs. lefthook, deferred until Step 5 picks the sync-script runtime. Whether to add commitlint on top of Conventional Commits. The three placeholder classes above (`org`/`repo_url`, `license_name`, CODEOWNERS handles) all need the actual GitHub destination decided (build plan Q2) before they can be filled for real.

**Real GitHub Actions SHA pins:** `actions/checkout@{PIN_ME}`, `actions/setup-node@{PIN_ME}`, and `github/codeql-action/*@{PIN_ME}` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `codeql.yml` need to be resolved to real commit SHAs before this CI would actually run (`gh api repos/actions/checkout/git/ref/tags/v4.x.x --jq '.object.sha'`, same pattern for the other two). This session's GitHub API access was blocked, so these were left as clearly-broken sentinel strings, not real SHAs, and not silently guessed.

**CI shape itself is provisional:** the CI template assumes an npm/Node project (`actions/setup-node`, `.nvmrc`, `{package_manager}` cache). This repo's real tooling language is not yet fixed (Step 5 will write the sync script; the Hive's own convention for this kind of script is Python, per `learn/scripts/generate-harnesses.py`). If Step 5 lands a Python-only sync script with no Node dependency at all, `ci.yml` should be revisited then, either dropped down to a pure-Python job or kept only if a JS/Node component turns out to be needed for one of the four harness syncs (e.g. a Cursor or Codex config generator).

**Not shipped by this skill, named as a gap:** `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is not in this skill's template set.

## Closing the loop

Nothing created in this step has been committed. Per the Ship Gate, `security-stinger` → `quality-stinger` → `github-repo-health-stinger` must run in that order, with reports landing in this same `library/requirements/reports/` directory, before any `git commit`/`git push`, and the user must review and approve. This repo is not yet a git repository (`git init` was intentionally not run, per the user's explicit instruction that they'll formalize the repo later), so the Ship Gate applies once that happens, not now.

Proceeding to step 2 of the user's 7-step sequence: PRD authorship via `library-stinger`.

## Addendum: org resolved

While scaffolding the plugin folder tree (step 3), the existing `vibe-coding-tools` plugin's own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` was inspected for convention-matching and confirmed `"author": {"name": "Legion Code Inc"}`, `"repository": "https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools"`. This resolves the `org` placeholder with high confidence (it also matches the user's own email domain, legioncodeinc.com): `org` = `legioncodeinc`, `repo_url` = `https://github.com/legioncodeinc/website-audit-toolset`. All prior `TBD-GITHUB-ORG`/`TBD-owner`/repo-URL placeholders across `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `.github/CODEOWNERS` have been updated accordingly. `license_name` remains genuinely undecided and untouched. Repository visibility (public GitHub vs. internal-only, build-plan Q2) is still the user's call; the URL above is the shape it would take if public under the existing org.

## Addendum: license resolved

User instruction: proprietary. `LICENSE` now holds an all-rights-reserved proprietary notice for
Legion Code Inc. `README.md`'s License section, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `license` field, and
all 21 `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter `license` fields (previously a stub default of `MIT`) were
updated to `Proprietary` and `scripts/sync-harnesses.py` was re-run to propagate the change into
the three generated manifests. `python3 scripts/sync-harnesses.py --check` confirms no drift.
