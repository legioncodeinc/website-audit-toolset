# Contributing to Website Auditor by Legion Code Inc.

Thanks for putting in the work to improve this project. This document covers what a contributor needs before opening a pull request.

## Before you start

- {If there's a CLA, contributor agreement, or issue-first policy, state it here. Delete this section if there's none.}
- Search open issues and pull requests before starting substantial work, so two people don't build the same thing.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legioncodeinc/website-audit-toolset
cd Website Auditor by Legion Code Inc.
echo "No package manifest yet: this repo is primarily markdown Stingers/Bees plus scripts. Add install steps once the sync-script runtime (Step 5) and any validation tooling are chosen."
```

See the [README](./README.md#development) for the full local dev setup.

## Branching and commits

- Branch off `main` for every change. Name branches `wa/{short-description}` (e.g. `feat/add-search-filter`).
- Write commit messages in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`. Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` before the colon (`feat!: ...`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Keep commits focused. If a commit conforms to more than one type, split it.

## Before opening a pull request

Run the full local gate:

```bash
python3 references/scripts/per-type-validation.py --all   # placeholder: wire up once validation scripts land (Step 4/5)
echo "N/A: no statically-typed source in this repo yet"
echo "N/A: no automated test suite yet"
```

All three must pass. The pull request template will ask you to confirm this.

## Pull requests

- Fill out every section of the [pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
- Keep pull requests small and single-purpose. A PR that does three unrelated things is three PRs.
- Link the issue it closes, if any.
- Expect review comments to land in the blocker / suggestion / nit taxonomy; only blockers must be resolved before merge.

## Code review

- CODEOWNERS are requested automatically for files they own; wait for their approval on those paths.
- Address review feedback with new commits rather than force-pushing over history mid-review, so reviewers can see what changed.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the [issue templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Do not report security vulnerabilities as public issues: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Release process

{Describe how a merged PR becomes a release: who cuts it, what triggers a version bump, where CHANGELOG.md gets updated. See CHANGELOG.md for the format.}

## Questions

{Where to ask: a Discussions tab, a chat channel, an email alias. Fill this in or delete the section.}
