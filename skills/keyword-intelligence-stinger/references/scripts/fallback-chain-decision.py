"""fallback-chain-decision.py: deterministic tier-selection for keyword-intelligence-worker-bee.

Owner: keyword-intelligence-stinger (local script; no central shared/scripts/ entry exists for
this domain, see references/scripts/README.md). Forge stage: 4 (References), authored against
references/research/distilled-keyword-intelligence.md and guides/05-fallback-chain-and-
provenance.md. Harness-portable: stdlib only (argparse, json, os, sys), no absolute paths.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES
Implements PRD-006's binding 4-tier source-priority chain as an explicit, auditable decision,
instead of leaving "which tier did we actually use, and why" as an implicit judgment made mid-run
and never written down. Per PRD-006 AC-1/AC-2, every run must record which tier(s) produced its
output and, when a tier was skipped, why.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO
- It does not call the Google Search Console MCP, fetch a Trends export, run AI inference, or call
  a paid API itself. Those are the Bee's own actions, using this Stinger's other guides
  (guides/01 through guides/04). This script only takes the OUTCOME of checking each tier
  (connected? has data? export present? candidate count so far?) and returns which tier's output
  should be used, and why, as one auditable decision.
- Tier 4 (paid API) is never auto-selected as a simple "tier 3 failed" fallback, because tier 3
  (AI/statistical inference from crawled content) essentially always produces SOME candidates; it
  rarely "fails" outright the way an absent MCP connection or a missing customer file does. Per
  distilled-keyword-intelligence.md section 4's "Implementation implication for Tier 4," paid-API
  usage should be "gated behind an explicit cost/budget check rather than called opportunistically."
  This script therefore only escalates to tier 4 when BOTH the running candidate count is below
  PRD-006's required minimum (75 keywords / 25 questions) AND an explicit budget-approval flag is
  set, matching that cost-gating discipline. A below-minimum count with no budget approval is
  reported as a stop-and-flag condition, never silently filled with fabricated candidates: PRD-006's
  binding Non-Goal is "does not fabricate search-volume numbers... for tier-3/tier-4-unavailable
  data," and the same honesty principle applies to fabricating candidate COUNT to hit the range.

Usage:
    python3 fallback-chain-decision.py \
        --target-type keywords \
        --gsc-mcp-connected --gsc-has-data \
        --candidate-count 40

    python3 fallback-chain-decision.py \
        --target-type keywords \
        --trends-export-dir path/to/content-targets/trends-raw \
        --candidate-count 82

    python3 fallback-chain-decision.py \
        --target-type questions \
        --candidate-count 18 \
        --paid-api-budget-approved

Prints a JSON decision object to stdout; exits 0 always (this is an advisory decision tool, not a
validator; the Bee still has to act on its output).
