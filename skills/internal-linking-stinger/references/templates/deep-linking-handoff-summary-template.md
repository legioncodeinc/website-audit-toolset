# Deep-linking handoff summary template

PRD-011 (this pair) and PRD-008 (`technical-seo-worker-bee`) both touch
deep-linking. Per PRD-011's Goals, this Bee "feeds a summary back for
prd-008's deep-linking sub-check rather than duplicating the full graph
analysis there." Copy this short block into `03-seo/internal-linking.md`'s
top (or a shared handoff location the run ledger points at) so
technical-seo-worker-bee can cite it instead of re-deriving a link graph.

Do not duplicate the full report here. This is a summary, not a re-export.

**Top 5 deepest reachable pages:** {slug (depth), ...}

**Top 5 most under-served pages by inbound link count that also carry
keyword targets** (cross-referenced against `content-targets/keywords.md`
if available): {slug (inbound count), ...}

Full detail, per-page rows, and the anchor-quality/equity tables are in
`03-seo/internal-linking.md`. Do not re-run `link-graph.py`;
technical-seo-worker-bee should read this summary and the full report
rather than recomputing the graph, per the shared-workspace contract's
write-once/read-many rule.
