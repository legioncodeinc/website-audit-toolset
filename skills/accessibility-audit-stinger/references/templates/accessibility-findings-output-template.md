# Accessibility findings output template

Copy-ready skeleton for what `accessibility-audit-worker-bee` writes to `06-accessibility/` (build plan section 3). Structured to satisfy `audit-scoring-worker-bee`'s mandatory-evidence rule (PRD-020 AC-5: a leaf finding without an evidence pointer or justification is rejected and returned to this Bee) on every leaf.

## Category-weight placement, open question for audit-scoring-worker-bee

This Bee's leaf scores below are written with individual evidence and justification, ready for cross-category rollup. Per `a11y-score-rollup-and-rating-bands.md` section 2, the build plan's eight-category weight table (section 4.2) does not name an explicit "Accessibility" line item; this Bee does not resolve that placement, it is named here as an open handoff item for `audit-scoring-worker-bee`'s own forge (PRD-020) to settle.

## Leaf findings

| SC | Level | Score | Weight | Evidence | Justification | Subjective? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {sc_ref} | {level} | {score} | 1 | {evidence_pointer} | {justification} | {yes/no} |

## Rejected/reframed candidates (verification log)

Per conduct rule 4, every candidate finding that failed verification is recorded here with the reason, not silently dropped.

| Candidate | Reason rejected/reframed |
|---|---|
| {candidate} | {reason} |
